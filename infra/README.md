# Infra

AWS CDK (TypeScript). **Every AWS resource is defined in this directory.** Do
not create buckets, clusters, roles, or repositories with the AWS CLI or
the console. `cdk bootstrap` and `cdk deploy` are the only AWS write
operations.

## Stacks

| Stack | Resources |
| --- | --- |
| `ChatticusSnapshots` | S3 bucket for computer packs; IAM role local hosts may assume |
| `ChatticusComputers` | VPC, ECR, ECS cluster, Fargate ARM64 task definition, service (count 0 by default) |
| `ChatticusSseSpike` | Throwaway Lambda plus CloudFront SSE transport feasibility spike (destroy when done) |

The snapshot bucket name is a CDK output. Hosts set
`CHATTICUS_SNAPSHOT_BUCKET` to that value. URIs look like
`s3://{SnapshotBucketName}/tenants/{tenant}/computers/{computer}/snapshot`.

v1 AWS computers are **Fargate**. Run one host with
`npx cdk deploy ChatticusComputers -c computerCount=1`. Scale back with
`-c computerCount=0`. Optional stop/start EC2 is not this stack.

A smoke publish from Fargate into S3:

```bash
sh computer/test_fargate.sh
```

## Deploy

```bash
cd infra
npm install
npx cdk bootstrap
npx cdk deploy --all
```

Then:

```bash
export CHATTICUS_SNAPSHOT_BUCKET=<SnapshotBucketName output>
```

A Fargate service exists at count 0 until you deploy
`-c computerCount=1` after pushing `ComputerRepositoryUri:dev`.
Publishing a snapshot does not require a running task.

## Synth (no AWS credentials required)

```bash
cd infra
npm install
npx cdk synth
```
